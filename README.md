### Creating Personal Access Token (PAT)
A personal access token is required to import additional libraries.
- It has to be a classic token (new fine grained tokens may not work).
- These permissions must be granted to PAT: **read:packages** and **read:project**
- Here are more details:
-  https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-gradle-registry
- Save the token in a safe place, i.e. 1Password.
- NOTE: This PAT is associated with your account.

### Specify user name and token as Shell Environment Variables
- In your shell file like .bash_profile, .zshrc, OR .zlogin, add these two statements:
```
export REPO_READ_USER=<<Your Email Adress>>
export REPO_READ_TOKEN=<<Your PAT>>
```
